# Create Tasks - Intelligent Task Breakdown

Create comprehensive task lists using Synapse System knowledge for optimal task decomposition and dependency management.

## Synapse-Powered Task Creation

### 1. Research Implementation Patterns
```bash
# Find similar feature implementations
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "feature implementation [feature type] [language]"

# Research task breakdown patterns
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "agile task breakdown [feature domain]"

# Get estimation patterns
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "task estimation [complexity] [language]"
```

### 2. Language-Specific Task Planning
```bash
# Get language-specific development workflows
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "development workflow [language]"

# Find testing task patterns
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "testing tasks [language] [feature type]"

# Research deployment task sequences
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "deployment tasks [language] [platform]"
```

### 3. Dependency Analysis
```bash
# Research component dependencies
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "dependency patterns [architecture]"

# Find integration task sequences
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "integration tasks [system type]"

# Get infrastructure setup tasks
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "infrastructure tasks [technology stack]"
```

## Enhanced Task Structure

### Development Tasks (Knowledge-Driven)
- **Setup & Configuration**: Use templates from `@neo4j/synapse_search.py "project setup [language]"`
- **Core Implementation**: Apply patterns from `@neo4j/synapse_search.py "implementation patterns [feature]"`
- **Testing Strategy**: Follow `@neo4j/synapse_search.py "testing strategy [component type]"`
- **Integration Tasks**: Use `@neo4j/synapse_search.py "integration patterns"`

### Quality Assurance Tasks
```bash
# Get QA task patterns
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "quality assurance tasks [language]"

# Find code review checklists
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "code review tasks [feature type]"

# Research performance testing tasks
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "performance testing [system type]"
```

### Documentation and Deployment Tasks
```bash
# Get documentation task templates
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "documentation tasks [project type]"

# Find deployment task sequences
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "deployment checklist [platform]"

# Research monitoring setup tasks
@neo4j/synapse_search.py "monitoring setup [infrastructure]"
```

This approach ensures task creation leverages proven patterns and considers all aspects of feature development from the knowledge graph.
