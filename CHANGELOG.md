## [2024.1.0] - Unified CLI and Update System

Major release introducing unified command interface and intelligent update system.

### ‚ú® Added

**üîß Unified CLI System:**
- **Single `synapse` command**: Replaces multiple entry points with one intelligent CLI
- **Context detection**: Automatically finds projects by walking up directories
- **Smart routing**: Detects project vs global operations automatically
- **All functionality unified**: `synapse start/stop/init/update/search/etc`

**üîÑ Smart Update System:**
- **`synapse update`**: Update project agents and configuration
- **Version tracking**: Each agent has timestamp + checksum version
- **Update detection**: Compare project vs system agent versions
- **Rollback support**: Safe updates with automatic rollback on failure
- **Copy vs symlink**: Choose stable copies or auto-updating symlinks

**üìä Version Management:**
- **Agent manifest**: Complete metadata for all 16 agents with checksums
- **Integrity verification**: `synapse manifest verify` checks agent corruption
- **Version display**: `synapse version` shows system and project versions
- **Health monitoring**: `synapse health` comprehensive system diagnostics

**üìã Command Consolidation:**
- **Service management**: `synapse start/stop/status`
- **Project operations**: `synapse init [dir] [--link]`, `synapse update [dir] [-y]`
- **Knowledge access**: `synapse search/standards/template`
- **System management**: `synapse version/manifest/health`
- **Tool access**: `synapse tool <name>` for debugging

### üîÑ Changed

**üìÅ Architecture Reorganization:**
- **`bin/synapse`**: New unified executable entry point
- **`lib/` directory**: Python modules for CLI, project, update, version management
- **Legacy compatibility**: `synapse.sh` now delegates to new CLI
- **Agent versioning**: All agents now tracked with timestamp.checksum format

**‚öôÔ∏è Project Configuration:**
- **Enhanced `.synapse.yml`**: Added version tracking and deployment method
- **Agent versions**: Track individual agent versions in project config
- **Deployment modes**: Support both copy and symlink deployment
- **Update tracking**: Record creation and update timestamps

**üîç Command Consistency:**
- **Standardized paths**: All commands use `synapse` instead of `synapse.sh`
- **Context awareness**: Commands work from anywhere, find project context
- **Error handling**: Improved error messages and validation
- **Help system**: Comprehensive help for all commands

### üõ†Ô∏è Improved

**üìñ Documentation Unified:**
- **README.md**: Concise overview with quick start
- **USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive user guide with all commands
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Technical architecture and contribution guide
- **Consistent examples**: All docs use correct command syntax

**üîß Agent Management:**
- **16 total agents**: Complete set in `.synapse/agents/`
- **Manifest system**: JSON metadata with versions and checksums
- **Integrity checks**: Verify agents haven't been modified
- **Deployment flexibility**: Copy for stability, symlink for bleeding-edge

**‚ö° Performance & Reliability:**
- **Faster operations**: Intelligent caching and context detection
- **Better error handling**: Graceful failures with helpful messages
- **Health monitoring**: Proactive system health checks
- **Update safety**: Backup and rollback for failed updates

### üîß Technical Details

**New Python Modules:**
- `lib/cli.py`: Unified command-line interface with argument parsing
- `lib/project.py`: Project management, initialization, and configuration
- `lib/updater.py`: Update mechanism with version comparison and rollback
- `lib/version_manager.py`: Agent versioning, manifest, and integrity checks

**Version Schema:**
- System version: Semantic versioning (e.g., `2024.1.0`)
- Agent versions: `{timestamp}.{checksum}` (e.g., `1758107914.627812e8`)
- Project tracking: Individual agent versions in `.synapse.yml`

**Update Algorithm:**
1. Load project configuration
2. Compare agent versions (project vs system)
3. Generate update list with changes
4. User confirmation (unless `-y` flag)
5. Apply updates with rollback support
6. Update project configuration

### üì¶ Deployment Options

**Copy Deployment (Default):**
```bash
synapse init .
# Stable agents, manual updates via `synapse update`
```

**Symlink Deployment:**
```bash
synapse init . --link
# Auto-updating agents, bleeding-edge features
```

### üéØ Migration Guide

**From Legacy Systems:**
- Replace `synapse.sh` calls with `synapse`
- Projects auto-migrate on first `synapse update`
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
- Legacy `synapse.sh` still works (with warning)

## [2025-09-17] - System Refactoring and Enhancement

This release includes a major refactoring of the Synapse agent system, as well as several new features and improvements.

### Added

*   **New Agents:**
    *   `@architect`: A new agent responsible for high-level system design and architecture.
    *   `@devops-engineer`: A new agent responsible for CI/CD, deployment, and infrastructure.
    *   `@ux-designer`: A new agent responsible for user experience and user interface design.
    *   `@security-specialist`: A new agent responsible for application security.
    *   `@docs-writer`: A new agent responsible for writing and maintaining documentation.
    *   `@planner`: A new agent responsible for decomposing high-level goals into actionable plans.
    *   `@tool-runner`: A new agent responsible for executing tools for other agents.
*   **`sync-agents.sh` script:** A new script to sync agent definitions from the `.synapse/agents` directory to the `.claude/agents` directory.
*   **`templates` directory:** A new directory to store modular file templates.
*   **`README.md` for core scripts:** A new `README.md` file in the `.synapse/neo4j/` directory to explain the purpose of the core scripts.
*   **`tool-mapping.json`:** A new file that defines the mapping between abstract tool names and their corresponding scripts.

### Changed

*   **Consolidated Agent Definitions:** All agent definitions are now located in the `.synapse/agents` directory. The `.claude/agents` directory is now populated by the `sync-agents.sh` script.
*   **Standardized Tool Definitions:** All agent definitions now use the high-level, abstract Synapse tools (`SynapseSearch`, `SynapseStandard`, `SynapseTemplate`, `SynapseHealth`).
*   **Updated `@synapse-project-manager`:** The `@synapse-project-manager` agent has been updated to be aware of the new team structure and to delegate tasks to the other agents.
*   **Simplified `@date-checker`:** The `@date-checker` agent has been simplified to use the `date` command.
*   **Modularized `@file-creator` templates:** The file templates have been moved from the `@file-creator` agent definition to the new `templates` directory.
*   **Improved `@git-workflow` error handling:** The `@git-workflow` agent now has a more robust error handling section.
*   **Improved `@test-runner` instructions:** The `@test-runner` agent now has more detailed, language-specific instructions for running tests.
*   **Improved Language Specialist collaboration:** The language specialist agents now have explicit instructions on how to collaborate with other team members.

### Removed

*   **Redundant `project-manager.md` agent:** The redundant `project-manager.md` agent has been removed from the `.claude/agents` directory.
